Exploring UIElement for the UI of **VirtuRow** and developing a tool to better integrate UIElement with the Unity engine, creating a more familiar workflow, similar to working with GameObjects.

I built a tool to better integrate UIElement with Unity, making UI development for VirtuRow much smoother and more familiar. By introducing a flexible Data Binding API and a UIObject system, I made it easier for both designers and developers to work with complex UIs. This project took time and effort, but it significantly improved our workflow and UI maintainability.

> In this article, I talk about work I've done for my company. I'm not able to provide any source code or build.

At my current company, we are working on a gamified training sports app for rowing, called **VirtuRow**. The app allows users to row solo or online, in 3D environments.

It is aimed at amateur rowers who might need extra motivation—a gamified app can help—or seasoned rowers who want to train with their mates online, track their progress, and have a bit of competition.

## Context

VirtuRow has many UI screens, with a moderately complex flow and layout, and sometimes a lot of data to display.

{: .note} 

In previous projects, I implemented UI using [uGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@3.0/manual/index.html) _(Canvas, RectTransform, etc.)_. But for this game, I decided to use [UIElement](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ui-systems/introduction-ui-toolkit.html).

The Unity project started on **Unity 2022.3 LTS**, and on this version, UIElement seemed mature enough to be used in production. Unity is also focusing all their efforts on pushing this new UI solution, so I wanted to learn how to work with it properly and be "future proof".

### The state of UIElement

After my initial tests with UIElement, I was a bit disappointed.

The base workflow is good: having a clear separation between layout and style _(with UXML and USS)_, and a proper tool to build UI _(UI Builder)_.

However, the integration with the rest of the engine is poor. My main concerns were:
- The workflow is too different compared to working with GameObject:
    - It is not possible to reference Unity assets in fields in the inspector, unlike other tools in Unity _(such as passing a ScriptableObject to the UI, for example)_.
    - Overall, UIElement / UI Builder is very disconnected and just sits on top of Unity, with no real interconnection.
- Implementing runtime code for UI logic is not ideal:
    - By design, implementing custom UI logic is inheritance-based _(inherit from the `VisualElement` type)_, and not the traditional composition workflow of GameObject.
    - It requires a lot of boilerplate and glue code to hook everything into the update loop.
    - To get a reference to a VisualElement instance, you must query it by its string ID, which can lead to bugs if the UI layout changes.
- Not very designer-friendly _(in my opinion)_:
    - The UI Builder has poor UX and many bugs; it is sometimes very frustrating to work with.
    - Apart from UI Builder, there is nothing else, so creating a new UI screen or widget often requires programming.
- No data binding\*

> \*In newer Unity versions, there is runtime data binding, but I think it is too limited and the integration is not good.
{: .note}

## Trying to improve that

As I said, the foundation of UIElement is somewhat okay. I like the UXML and USS workflow, and the runtime performance seems to be better than uGUI.

It is the integration with the rest of the engine that I don't like, so I decided to improve that.

### Developing a proper Data Binding API

My first goal was to develop a solid foundation, and for UI, I think it starts with a proper way to bind data to VisualElement.

In VirtuRow, there is a lot of data to display to the player, in several places: in the HUD during a game session, in the progress screen, in the multiplayer lobby, etc.

There are many numeric values, arrays, and lists of elements, coming from the local client, the server, or back-end services, etc.

Here are the main design constraints I set for the API:
- Should be able to expose any type of data _(primitives, classes and structs, arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)_
- Should be able to access data with a path _(based on the layout of classes and structs, etc.)_
- Should support async operations
    - For example, reading or writing data to a remote server
- Reading or writing data with the API should be transparent, no matter the source or type of the underlying data
- Should be able to observe changes to the value of the underlying data

The API I developed is focused on presenting a set of properties for a given data value. The data are accessed with a path, and read and write operations are available. The underlying logic of reading and writing a given data is not known to the caller.

Here is an overview of the final API I implemented:

| Interface                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `IDataPresenter`       | A presenter is responsible for defining `IData` for a given type _(for example `Vector3`)_. For each of these data, it defines how to read and write them. These data are written into an `IDataBag`, using the `IDataBagWriter` instance passed to the `IDataPresenter.WriteData` method. |
| `IDataBag`             | A bag is a collection of `IData`, which can be accessed with a path. |
| `IDataBagWriter`       | A bag writer is responsible for adding new `IData` to an `IDataBag`. |
| `IData`                | Represents a data item, and defines the read and write operations _(how to get and set the underlying value)_. |
| `IArrayData`, `IDictionaryData`, `IEnumerableData` | Represent a collection of data, and define how to get, set, add, and remove items. |

It is possible to implement custom `IDataPresenter` for any type, but there is a default implementation, `ReflectionPresenter`, that uses reflection to expose fields and properties of any C# type.

### Integrating UIElement with Unity

Next, I developed a deep integration of UIElement into Unity, that unifies it with the other tools and brings a familiar workflow.

The main element of that tool is the new UIObject asset. This is basically the UI equivalent of a GameObject, and it has almost the same functionality and workflow.

An overview of the features of UIObject:
- Can add and create components
    - Like GameObject and their MonoBehaviours, it is possible to add UIComponents and create new ones
    - At runtime, UIComponents have a proper lifecycle loop (OnEnable, OnDisable, Update, etc.)
- Deeply integrated with the **Data Binding API**
    - It is possible to add and create Data Sources, which will expose any type of data to a UIObject and its components
    - Can easily bind data to a VisualElement _(a Label, ListView, Slider, etc.)_
    - It is possible to apply transformations on data _(format a numeric value into a string, filter items in a collection, convert a value from one unit to another, etc.)_
    - A designer can bind data to a complex UI without any code
- A complete and easy-to-use Inspector
    - Displays the hierarchy of the VisualTreeAsset, the list of Data Sources, and the components
    - Can easily reference any VisualElement in components with drag and drop, just like GameObject
    - Displays clear errors and warnings, for example when a VisualElement reference is broken
- Additional features
    - UIAction: a more granular way to implement custom behaviour, that can be reused in any component
    - UISignal: a small asset that can be used to notify one or more listeners that something happened
- Extensibility
    - Almost everything can be extended, to implement very specific UI logic
    - New UIComponent
    - New Data Transformation
    - New Data Source
    - New UIAction
    - etc.

### Managing UI navigation with UIFlow API

I've also implemented a **UIFlow API**, that allows easy implementation of the runtime UI flow. Right now, it is only possible by code, with a very easy-to-use public API.

```cs
/**
For example, this is how the entire UI flow of VirtuRow is defined.

It is a state machine, where each state is a UIObject or a nested UI Flow.
It is possible to define output events and conditions.
*/

public override StateMachine Create(VisualElement container, in IList<IErrorWatcher> errorWatchers)
{
    var stateMachine = StateMachine.Create()
        // STATE : Home
        .EntryState(homePanel.panel.AsState(container), out var homeState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(homePanel.freeRowButton))
                .To(mapSettingsPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var mapSettingsState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(homePanel.raceButton))
                .To(ref mapSettingsState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(homePanel.joinLobbyButton))
                .To(loadingPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var joinLobbyLoadState)
            .CatchSubsequentUserFlowErrors()
                .Handle<VirtuRowUserFlowException>()
        // STATE : Map setting
        .ContinueWith(mapSettingsState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(mapSettingsPanel.applyButton))
                .To(loadingPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var lobbyLoadState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(mapSettingsPanel.backButton))
                .ToPrevious()
        // STATE : Join Lobby Load
        .ContinueWith(joinLobbyLoadState)
            .Out()
                .OnUISignal(joinLobbyDoneSignal)
                .To(freeRowLobbyPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var lobbyState)
        // STATE : Lobby Load
        .ContinueWith(lobbyLoadState)
            .Out()
                .OnUISignal(createLobbyDoneSignal)
                .To(ref lobbyState)
        // STATE : Lobby
        .ContinueWith(lobbyState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(freeRowLobbyPanel.mapSettingsButton))
                .To(freeRowLobbyMapSettingsPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var lobbyMapSettingsState)
            .Out() // To players list
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(freeRowLobbyPanel.playersListButton))
                .To(lobbyPlayersListPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var lobbyPlayersListState)
            .Out() // Leave lobby
                .OnUISignal(leaveLobbySignal)
                .To(ref homeState)
            .Out()
                .When(_ => MultiplayClientManager.Lobby.Events.OnLobbyStateChange())
                .If((state, ev) => ev.CurrentState == LobbyState.Connecting)
                .To(loadingPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var gameModeLoading)
            .CatchSubsequentUserFlowErrors()
                .Handle<VirtuRowUserFlowException>()
        // STATE : Map settings from Lobby
        .ContinueWith(lobbyMapSettingsState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(freeRowLobbyMapSettingsPanel.applyButton))
                .ToPrevious()
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(freeRowLobbyMapSettingsPanel.backButton))
                .ToPrevious()
        // STATE : Lobby players list
        .ContinueWith(lobbyPlayersListState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(lobbyPlayersListPanel.backButton))
                .ToPrevious()
        // STATE : Game Mode loading
        .ContinueWith(gameModeLoading)
            .Out() // > to Free Row HUD
                .When(GameServerManager.OnGameModeStart())
                .If(() => GameServerManager.GetGameMode() is FreeRowMode)
                .To(freeRowHUDPanel.panel.AsState(container), out var freeRowHUDState)
            .Out() // > to Race Mode HUD
                .When(GameServerManager.OnGameModeStart())
                .If(() => GameServerManager.GetGameMode() is SprintRaceMode)
                .To(sprintRaceModeFlow, container).OutputState(ref homeState)
        // STATE : Free Row HUD
        .ContinueWith(freeRowHUDState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(freeRowHUDPanel.pauseButton))
                .To(pausePopupPanel.panel.AsState("Popup"), out var pausePopupState)
        // STATE : Pause
        .ContinueWith(pausePopupState)
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(pausePopupPanel.resumeButton))
                .ToPrevious()
            .Out()
                .When(state => state.OnEvent<ClickEvent>(pausePopupPanel.pairingButton))

                .To(sessionResultsPanel.panel.AsState("Popup"), out var sessionResultState)
        // STATE : Pairing from Pause
        .ContinueWith(pausePairingState)
            .Out()

                .To(ref homeState)
        .Terminate();

    errorWatchers.Add(new VirtuRowNetworkErrorWatcher());

    return stateMachine;
}
```

In the future, I would like to make a visual graph tool to do that without any code, and that is also deeply integrated with UIObject, the Data Binding API, and the rest of the Unity engine.

## Lessons learned and takeaways

This project was really cool to work on, and proved to be useful in the VirtuRow project. Integrating and maintaining UI with it is easy, but still allows for complex use cases.

So, what went right:
- I was able to clearly identify the needs for our project, and translate them into an easy-to-use tool
- The tool itself is also reusable on other projects
- I now have a very deep knowledge of UIElement, and I'm confident enough with it to work on future projects that use it
- Using this tool, we were able to integrate and iterate very quickly on the UI of VirtuRow

And to finish, what went wrong:
- As always with this kind of tool, it took quite a long time to get a result _(4 to 5 months)_
- I had a lot of headaches working on the Data Binding API, especially with the implementation of async data (it took me a long time to figure out a good solution)
- There are performance issues that need to be taken care of _(so far it was not a bottleneck though)_

Thank you for reading!
