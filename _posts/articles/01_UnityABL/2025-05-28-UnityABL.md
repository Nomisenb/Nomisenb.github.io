Why and how I develop a tool that allows to bind a Java library into a .NET Assembly that can be used in Unity.

In this article, I share the technical challenges I faced integrating a Java-based SDK into a Unity project for the **VirtuRow** rowing app, developed at my company.
I explain how I developed a custom solution to bridge Unity and Java, allowing me to use third-party hardware SDKs that aren’t natively supported by Unity.

At my current company, we are working on a gamified training sports app for rowing, called **VirtuRow**. The app allows users to row solo or online, in 3D environments.

It is aimed at amateur rowers who might need extra motivation—a gamified app can help—or seasoned rowers who want to train with their mates online, track their progress, and have a bit of competition.

To use the app, the user must connect a rowing machine via Bluetooth, which is used in-game to control their virtual boat.

## A bit of context

And … that is where things get complicated!

My current company is small, and I'm the only programmer on the VirtuRow project. The very talented team working with me consists of two artists (3D/2D), a UX/UI designer, and a game designer/producer. There is another similar team working on another project, and a team focused on our back-end, building the services that will support our games (which have online features, account management, progress tracking, etc.).

All that to say, I'm mostly a gameplay developer, and most of my experience is with Unity. I don't really have knowledge of hardware and Bluetooth stuff, and neither do my colleagues! Hiring someone to do that was not possible at the time, so …
… That is quite the challenge!

## External SDK search

After a couple of months working on a prototype for the app, I was able to get a very solid experience of most of the base features (mostly the online stuff, and the physics calculations for the boat).

We were still not able to test the app with a real rowing machine, but in parallel with working on the prototype, we found a company that does exactly what we needed: they provide an SDK for iOS and Android to connect to a wide variety of rowing machines and interact with them. The company is [MoveLab](https://movelab.studio/), and we partnered with them to work on the app.

So this is the perfect world, I have nothing more to do than work on the game! Yeeahhh …

## Hmm ... not that simple ...

The world is not perfect, I'm sad …

From there, we were facing a number of issues, and I had to decide the right things to do for the project.

Right from the beginning, we encountered a significant one: MoveLab provides a great tool, but their SDK is only built for Java (for Android devices) and Swift (iOS devices). We are their first client working on a game with the Unity engine, and they do not provide any kind of integration for it.

Unfortunately, they were not able to work on their own solution for Unity.

Which means, we had to do it internally at my company … Which means I had to do it!

To make things a bit easier for me, I decided to focus all my effort on the Android SDK. Working on Android with Unity is quicker, as iterating on builds is faster than for iOS (at least I think …). You build your game, you get an APK, it is installed on your device and it runs (hopefully), and I can continue working on my Windows PC.

## It's time to make a tool!

So, I'm here with a third-party tool that I can't just drag and drop into Unity and use right away …

### First step: running Java code in Unity

Unity has a way to call Java code from C#, which is a good starting point.
It is the **AndroidJNI** API. You can find info here: [https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-plugins-java-code-from-c-sharp.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-plugins-java-code-from-c-sharp.html)

The good:
- It exists

The bad:
- Everything is string-based. To reference anything (a class, a method, a field, etc.) you need to know their very specific string representation.
- Because of that, it requires a very deep knowledge of the Java libraries you need to use (which is not my case here …)
- The MoveLab SDK for Android is developed with Kotlin. I don't know much about it, but Kotlin code, once compiled, doesn't have a one-to-one correspondence with the original code structure. The string representation of any element cannot be easily determined.
- And it means I would need to remap the whole API of the SDK manually …

### Second step: looking for an existing solution

For Unity, apart from the AndroidJNI API, nothing exists.

After some time searching the web, I learned about Xamarin, and more specifically Xamarin for Android ([more info here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/xamarin/android/)). I knew it by name, but never used it.

What caught my attention is that Xamarin has a way to let you bind a Java library to a .NET assembly DLL ([more info here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/xamarin/android/platform/binding-java-library/)).

Great!

In short: with Visual Studio, it is possible to create an "Android Binding Library" that will take an **.aar** or **.jar** file as input and generate a .NET assembly that maps the API of the Java library.

[![VS Binding process](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema01.png)](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema01.png)

That's something, but …
- It is only possible to bind one Java library at a time, but the MoveLab SDK comes with a lot of these **.aar** compiled files, that have dependencies on each other.
- And obviously, it is for the Xamarin platform. The output DLL doesn't work with Unity.

### Third step: digging deeper …

So far, the Xamarin solution was the best I had. From there, I decided to hack my way through it, and got convinced that I could get it working with Unity.

#### A look inside a compiled .NET assembly

Let me introduce you to my best friend on this project: [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)

ILSpy is a .NET assembly browser and decompiler. You can open a .NET DLL and see the compiled IL bytecode and its C# form.

With that, I can take a look at the output DLL from the Xamarin Android Binding Library. So let's see how a method call from C# to Java is made. This was the starting point of my investigation, and for that I needed to scale things down to the minimum.

**Here is the plan:** make a very simple Java library > compile it and feed it into the Android Binding Library tool > open the output DLL in ILSpy

[![ILSpy](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema02.png)](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema02.png)

A quick breakdown of the output DLL:
1. *Dummy* class, that is defined in the Java library
2. *MyMethod()* from that class
3. The generated C# code, that performs the call to the Java JVM
4. The 2 references, **Java.Interop** and **Mono.Android**, that actually handle the transition between the C# and Java world

#### A simple idea: replace Java.Interop and Mono.Android with my own implementation

Here we are! I think I have an idea, terrible and probably cursed, but it's all I have!

I'll make my own implementation of Java.Interop and Mono.Android, but use the Unity AndroidJNI API internally.

[![DLL implementation](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema03.png)](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema03.png)

I've done that, imported everything into Unity, carefully ignored warnings and errors that didn't prevent compilation, built an APK, tested on a device …

And it worked!

I can call my very simple Java method from my C# code, using a strongly typed API.

To get to this point from the starting point, where we partnered with MoveLab, **it took me one month**.

#### From a crazy idea to a (somewhat) working implementation

Once I got confident enough I could get the plan to work, I then implemented more and more of my Java.Interop and Mono.Android API, to support more complex code:
- Any kind of methods: instance, static, with or without parameters, with or without return value, etc.
- Any types: primitives, Java classes, arrays, lists, interfaces, etc.
- Interface proxy: implement a Java interface from C# code, that can then be passed to and used by Java code
- Memory management
- …

From the early test of this idea to this point … **it took me 4 months …**

#### Automating the binding workflow

In parallel with working on the Java.Interop and Mono.Android implementation, I developed a command-line tool to automate the process of binding a Java library to a .NET assembly.

[![UnityABL build](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema04.gif)](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema04.gif)

It takes a JSON configuration file that looks like this:
```
{
    "ProjectName": "DummyAARLibrary",
    "DLLOutputFolder": "Output",
    "MonoAndroidDLLPath": ".\\JavaDLLs\\Mono.Android.dll",
    "GlobalMetadataPath": "./Metadata.xml",
    "Libraries": [
        {
            "Name": "DummyAARLibrary-release",
            "Path": "..\\DummyAARLibrary\\DummyAARLibrary\\build\\outputs\\aar\\DummyAARLibrary-release.aar",
            "Dependencies": [
                "OtherDummyAARLibrary-release"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Name": "OtherDummyAARLibrary-release",
            "Path": "..\\DummyAARLibrary\\OtherDummyAARLibrary\\build\\outputs\\aar\\OtherDummyAARLibrary-release.aar"
        }
    ],
    "Clean": false
}
```
[![UnityABL process](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema05.png)](/assets/articles/01_UnityABL/Schema05.png)

There is a "post-process" step, during which the IL bytecode of some methods, classes, and the resulting assembly is modified using [Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil).

This has to be done because:
- It allows fixing the dependency to Java.Interop and Mono.Android, so my own implementation is correctly used and Unity doesn't complain.
- It fixes the way interface instances are passed to my own implementation. The generated code from Xamarin Android Binding Library could not be used directly, because of how the Unity AndroidJNI API handles interfaces.

With this tool, every step is automated and it reduces the iteration time to get the binding working for Unity.

### Project results & lessons learned

Phew, what a ride!

I'll start with what went right on this tool project:
- The most important thing: making all of this made it possible to use the MoveLab SDK in Unity and I could work on the game features that needed it
- I was able to go from a hypothesis to a working sample quite fast
- There are a lot of tools and documentation available that made this project possible: ILSpy, ILRepack, Mono.Cecil, the Xamarin documentation and tools, etc.

Then, what went wrong:
- This whole project took 5 months, and during that time I was not able to do any work on the actual game (being the only programmer on the project)
- I was faced with some very difficult technical challenges, that made this project very uncertain
    - I have no experience with Java, none with Xamarin, had to spend a lot of time deciphering obscure IL bytecode, etc.
    - Getting interface proxies to work, fixing the memory leaks and crashes, etc. was a nightmare!
    - …
- This whole process is only for Android, I would need to do that again for iOS
- ~~I hate Java~~
